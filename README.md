Hi!

First of all apologies for submitting this so late, had a bit of a crazy week...

I didn't have too much time to complete this, so it's pretty basic.

To run it just cd to the directory and run 'node index.js'

It currently just runs the getProcessingPage function 4 times, covering each different outcome.
Feel free to add more.
